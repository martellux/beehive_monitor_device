# beehive_monitor_device
A rudimentary device for the environmental monitoring of beehives based on ESP32 board.

## Some details

### 1. The Board
The board used for this project is a standard ESP32-DevKitC [ESPRESSIF Website](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc).
The board has been flashed with MicroPython firmware v1.19.1 [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/)

###Â 2. The Sensor
The sensor used for this project is a standard DHT22 [Specifications](https://components101.com/sensors/dht22-pinout-specs-datasheet)

### 3. The Software
The software for the measurement and for the BLE connections has been developed using MicroPython for ESP32 [Docs](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/quickref.html)

### 4. The Box
A tailored Lego-based box has been designed for containing the ESP32 board and a PowerBank as power supplier. Further, some peculiarities have been provided for cables and sensor.

The design hass been realized with with Studio by bricklink [Download](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page) and can be downloaded here [Source file](https://github.com/martellux/beehive_monitor_device/blob/develop/box/BoxSmall.io?raw=true)

### 5. How to use it
Once powered, the board starts emitting the BLE advertising packet and it become discoverable and connectable from a BLE client. The name is "swarm-env-sensor".
After the connection, the board shows up the following configuration:

Service | Characteristic
--- | ---
"Environmental Sensing" service with UUID 181A | "Digital" characteristic with UUID 2A56
| "Digital Output" characteristic with UUID 2A57
